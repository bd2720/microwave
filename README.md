# Microwave (Timer)
A microwave-themed timer app created with `Next.js` + `React` + `TypeScript` + `Tailwind CSS`.
- While the microwave is not cooking, its display will show the current local time.
- Press `Cook Time`, then enter a time and press `START`. The microwave's door will glow when it is cooking.
- Use `Add 30 Sec` to increase the running timer by 30 seconds without pausing, or to immediately begin cooking for 30 seconds.

## Controls
- `Cook Time` enables entering a desired cook time `(mm:ss)`
- `Digits (0-9)` append a digit to the desired cook time
- `Start` starts cooking for the duration entered
- `Stop` stops cooking or inputting cook time
- `Add 30 Sec` adds 30 seconds to current cook time; can be used to start cooking immediately
- `Door Handle` stops cooking
